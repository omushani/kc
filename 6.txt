1. Design an HTML Weekly Timetable and upload it to GitHub.

2. Write steps to integrate Kubernetes with Docker, and explore basic kubectl commands.

3. Create a job that runs every 2 minutes and prints the system date/time in Jenkins.

2️⃣ Integrate Kubernetes with Docker + Basic kubectl Commands

In exams, they expect concept + few commands. Keep it short.

a) Steps to integrate Kubernetes with Docker

You can write:

Install Docker – to build and run container images.

Install Kubernetes tools – e.g. kubectl and a local cluster like Minikube or kind.

Configure Docker as container runtime (in older setups Docker is used as runtime; in newer, containerd etc., but just write this line in exam).

Start Kubernetes cluster (e.g. minikube start).

Use docker build to create images and tag them.

Push image to a registry (Docker Hub) or make it available to the cluster.

Use kubectl to create Pods/Deployments using that Docker image.

This is enough as “integration of Docker with Kubernetes”.

b) Basic kubectl commands

Write a block like this:

# Check cluster info
kubectl cluster-info

# List nodes
kubectl get nodes

# List pods
kubectl get pods

# Create deployment
kubectl create deployment myapp --image=nginx

# Expose deployment as service
kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=NodePort --port=80

# Describe a pod
kubectl describe pod POD_NAME

# Delete deployment
kubectl delete deployment myapp

3)
Steps to create this job (write in exam)

Open Jenkins → click New Item.

Enter job name → select Pipeline → click OK.

In configuration page, scroll to Build Triggers → tick Build periodically.

In Schedule, enter:

H/2 * * * *


(Runs every 2 minutes.)

In Pipeline section, choose Pipeline script and paste the Groovy code.

Click Save.

Jenkins will now run the job every 2 minutes and print system date/time in Console Output.
pipeline {
    agent any

    triggers {
        cron('H/2 * * * *')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Print Date and Time') {
            steps {
                bat 'echo %DATE% %TIME%'
            }
        }
    }
}
