1. Develop an HTML page showing your favorite books/movies and push it to GitHub.

2. Create a branch bio-update, add 3 hobbies to a file and push the branch.

3. Create and run a Simple Python containerized application (e.g., number guessing) using Docker.

1)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Favourite Books and Movies</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>My Favourite Books</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Harry Potter</li>
        <li>The Alchemist</li>
        <li>Wings of Fire</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Favourite Movies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inception</li>
        <li>Interstellar</li>
        <li>3 Idiots</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

2)2️⃣ Create branch bio-update, add 3 hobbies, push branch

Assume repo already exists and is connected to GitHub.

Commands (exactly like this in exam)
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b bio-update

# Create a file and add 3 hobbies
echo "My Hobbies:" > hobbies.txt
echo "1. Reading" >> hobbies.txt
echo "2. Playing games" >> hobbies.txt
echo "3. Watching movies" >> hobbies.txt

# Stage and commit the file
git add hobbies.txt
git commit -m "Add hobbies in bio-update branch"

# Push the new branch to GitHub
git push -u origin bio-update


You can also mention:

git branch → to list branches

git checkout main → to go back to main branch

3️⃣ Simple Python Number Guessing App in Docker

app.py → Python program

Dockerfile → to containerize

docker build + docker run commands

a) app.py
import random

print("Number Guessing Game")
secret = random.randint(1, 10)

guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))

if guess == secret:
    print("Correct! You guessed the number.")
else:
    print("Wrong! The correct number was:", secret)

b) Dockerfile
# Use Python image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy app file
COPY app.py .

# Run the Python program
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

c) Build and run container
# Build Docker image
docker build -t number-guess .

# Run container (with input support)
docker run -it number-guess


-t number-guess → image name is number-guess

-it → allows user input inside container
